- 👋 Hi, I’m @erjoyner
- 👀 I’m interested in better ways of connecting users with data to solve Wicked Problems in the Earth System.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Health and Air Quality issues, data, and services.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other beginning programmers... did I just say that I am a programmer? Go me!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at elizabeth.r.joyner@nasa.gov
