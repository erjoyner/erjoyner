- 👋 Hi, I’m @erjoyner, a contractor through ADNET, serving the RSES AMA contract at NASA Langley Research Center.
- 👀 I’m interested in better ways of connecting users with data to solve Wicked Problems in the Earth System.  
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring about how we can apply Earth Observation data to address issues related to Agriculture, Health and Air Quality Energy, Humanitarian issues and more!
